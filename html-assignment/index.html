                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                I grew up in Oshawa, Ontario, about 40 minutes east of Toronto. In high school I became interested in graphic design and animation after taking classes in my final years. I was planning on going to college and entering the world of digital art and media, however, at the very end of high school, I made a big change. I ended up in Toronto studying religion and English literature at a small liberal arts university in North York. I quickly became enthralled in that world. I absolutely love what I studied. My goal from my second year of university onward was to pursue academic studies as far as I could go, I wanted to earn my PhD and write, and teach in the field of religious studies.

                Things, however, took another turn. With only one semester left in my undergrad I dropped out of my program. As much as I loved my program and the things I was studying, I knew I could not finish, there was something else in store for me. After almost a year of working and trying to figure out my next steps I decided to move to Ottawa and enrol in the Interactive Media Design program. I am still passionate about religious studies and literature, I still spend most of my free time reading and writing, and I still want to teach, but the medium has changed. Rather than spend my time in a classroom, I would like to use the skills I learn in this program to create a platform the makes religious education available and accessible to anyone. Being a religious person, I see a need for thoughtful, engaging, and accessible content, and I hope to be a part of fulfilling that need.
